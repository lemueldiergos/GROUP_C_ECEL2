**Language Used:**

**Python** - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its easy-to-read syntax and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more

Libraries used in this system:

**Speech Recognition** - Library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline.
https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/

**Pyttsx3** - A text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/

**NLTK** - A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.

**Requests** - A simple, yet elegant, HTTP library. This will be used to access or request the current location to be asked.
https://pypi.org/project/requests/

**Tkinter** -  Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from the Tk interface.

**Datetime** - The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

**Psutil** - psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python. It is useful mainly for system monitoring, profiling and limiting process resources and management of running processes.
https://pypi.org/project/psutil/




**Tools**:

**Visual Studio Code** - Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git.

**Git** - Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers collaboratively developing software. Git's goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

**GitHub** - GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project
